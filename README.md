Stay the course after planning

 
There is someone out their foregoing their personal desires and comforts to reach a goalâ€¦ instead of being haunted by that person be that person.

 
You want to reach a position where you are managing.  Managing process or people.  You will then have the ability to be creative and more autonomy.

 
Pomodoroâ€™s can change your work completely.  They will allow you to work for much longer hours and be more focused during work.

 
Read as much as possible.  There is no such thing as being too informed on a subject.

 
Learning is a never-ending journey.


A recommended career path: work for a bigger firm at first, gain creditability.  Then go work for a smaller firm to get clients and have more autonomy over your work.  Once you have clients and actual value, the bigger firms will hire you back.  This will be much faster than internal promotions.


When choosing a job focus on your new manager.  They will be your mentor and have the ability to significantly improve your life.


Never think you are above anybody and always help people.


Find something you really love to do, and you will never work a day in your life.


Make sure to actively take care of your body and mental health.


When assigned a task do you best no matter if you enjoy the task for not.  This work ethic will show to your managers and superiors.
